### 1. Django ORM

#### Introduction
Django ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) is a feature that allows developers to interact with databases using Python code instead of writing raw SQL queries. It simplifies database operations and promotes a more Pythonic way of working with data.

### 2. Using ORM Queries in Django Shell

#### Example
```bash
# Start Django shell
python manage.py shell

# Using ORM queries
>>> from myapp.models import MyModel
>>> MyModel.objects.all()
<QuerySet [<MyModel: instance1>, <MyModel: instance2>]>
```

### 3. Turning ORM to SQL in Django Shell

#### Example
```bash
# Start Django shell
python manage.py dbshell

# Turning ORM to SQL
>>> print(str(MyModel.objects.all().query))
'SELECT "myapp_mymodel"."id", ... FROM "myapp_mymodel"'
```

### 4. Aggregations

#### Definition
Aggregations in Django ORM involve performing operations on a set of values, such as counting, summing, or finding the average. Commonly used aggregations include `Count`, `Sum`, `Avg`, etc.

#### Example
```python
from django.db.models import Count

# Counting instances
MyModel.objects.aggregate(count=Count('id'))
```

### 5. Annotations

#### Definition
Annotations in Django ORM involve adding calculated fields to query results. It allows you to include additional information in each result, derived from existing fields.

#### Example
```python
from django.db.models import F

# Annotating with calculated field
MyModel.objects.annotate(total=F('quantity') * F('price'))
```

### 6. Migration File

#### Definition
A migration file in Django is an auto-generated Python script that describes the changes to be made to the database schema. It is needed to keep the database schema in sync with changes in the models.

#### Example
```bash
# Creating a migration
python manage.py makemigrations

# Applying the migration
python manage.py migrate
```

### 7. SQL Transactions

#### Definition
SQL transactions are a concept in database management where a series of operations are executed as a single unit. Either all the operations are committed to the database or none of them are, ensuring data consistency.

### 8. Atomic Transactions

#### Definition
In Django, atomic transactions are a high-level way of performing database operations. It ensures that a series of database operations are executed as a single unit, and if any operation fails, the entire transaction is rolled back.

#### Example
```python
from django.db import transaction

# Using atomic transactions
@transaction.atomic
def my_function():
    # database operations
```
